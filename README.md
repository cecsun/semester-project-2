# Auction House

![image](/auction-house.png)

This project marks the culmination of three semesters of frontend development, aimed at creating a fully functional auction website. The goal was to deliver a responsive, user-focused platform where users can browse listings, place bids, and manage their profiles â€” all powered by the Noroff Auction API.

## Description

The platform focuses on user interaction, real-time bidding, and secure access to key features, showcasing effective API integration and dynamic frontend functionality.

- #### User Accounts and Credits:
  - Registered users start with 1000 credits to bid.
  - Guests can browse listings but must register to bid or create auctions.
- #### Auction Functionality
  - Users can create listings, place bids, and view credit balances.
  - Live updates via API ensure accurate bid tracking and listing status.
- #### Frontend Development
  - Built with JavaScript and styled using Bootstrap for responsive design.
  - Features include form validation, image upload, and profile management.
- #### Project Tools and Deployment
  - Designed in Figma, managed in Trello, and deployed via Netlify.
